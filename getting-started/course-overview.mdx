## What is a Mecanum Wheel Robot?

A **Mecanum wheel robot** is a type of mobile robot consisting of four special wheels based on rollers. It is designed for maneuverability, making it ideal for tasks like:

- **Warehouse packaging** - Navigate tight spaces and move in any direction
- **Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)** - Industrial material transport
- **Omnidirectional wheelchairs** - Enhanced mobility for users
- **Research platforms** - Study advanced motion control algorithms

The Swedish wheel (another name for Mecanum wheels) is gaining popularity due to its ability to move forward, backward, sideways, and rotate, all without changing orientation.

## Timeline and Milestones

<Note>
  **Important:** Information on Canvas has higher priority than this document if there are discrepancies. Always check Canvas for official deadlines.
</Note>

### Suggested Timeline (12-week semester)

| Week | Work Packages | Key Milestones |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 1-2  | Project Proposal | Team formation, contract, literature review |
| 2-5  | WP1 & WP2 | MATLAB kinematics, CAD design, order components |
| 4-8  | WP3 | ESP32 setup, motor control, PID tuning, IMU |
| 5-12 | WP4 | ROS2 installation, URDF, SLAM, navigation |
| 11-12| WP5 | System integration, testing, presentation |

<Tip>
  **Parallel Work:** Many work packages can be done in parallel by different team members. For example, while one team member works on MATLAB simulation, another can design the CAD model, and another can set up the ESP32 environment.
