    5. **Start early:** Order components and begin work immediately
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Task Distribution Strategies

### Work Package Assignment

Assign work packages based on skills and interest:

| Work Package | Recommended Skills | Team Members |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| WP1: MATLAB Simulation | MATLAB, Math, Kinematics | 1-2 members |
| WP2: CAD Design | Mechanical design, 3D modeling | 1-2 members |
| WP2: PCB Design | Electronics, circuit design | 1 member |
| WP3: Embedded Control | C/C++, microcontrollers | 1-2 members |
| WP4: ROS2 Setup & URDF | Linux, Python, XML | 1 member |
| WP4: ROS2 Navigation | ROS2, algorithms, Python/C++ | 2 members |
| WP5: Integration | Everyone (collaborative) | All members |
| Documentation & Reports | Strong writing, organization | 1-2 members + reviews from all |

<Note>
  **Overlap is good!** Two people working on complex work packages (WP4) provides redundancy and knowledge sharing.
</Note>

### Parallel vs Sequential Work

Some tasks can be done in parallel, others must be sequential:

**Parallel (Weeks 1-6):**
- Person A: MATLAB simulation (WP1)
- Person B: CAD design (WP2)
- Person C: PCB design (WP2)
- Person D: ESP32 environment setup (WP3)
- Person E: ROS2 environment setup (WP4)

**Sequential (Weeks 7-10):**
- Hardware must be built before testing
- ROS2 packages build on each other (URDF → Control → Localization → SLAM → Nav)
- Integration requires all subsystems ready
