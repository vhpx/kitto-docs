## Writing Tips

### Do's ✅

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="crosshairs">
    Instead of "we'll use sensors," write "we'll use RPLIDAR A1M8 for 360° scanning with 8m range"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Technical Language" icon="flask">
    This is an engineering document. Use proper terminology: "quadrature encoder," "PWM," "SLAM," etc.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Show Feasibility" icon="check">
    Demonstrate that your plan is realistic with timeline, budget, and available resources
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cite Sources" icon="quote-left">
    Every claim should be supported by references, especially in literature review
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Don'ts ❌

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Avoid Vague Statements" icon="circle-xmark">
    Don't say "we'll try to implement navigation." Say "we'll implement Nav2 stack with DWB local planner"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Plagiarize" icon="ban">
    All text must be original or properly quoted and cited. Use plagiarism checkers!
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Ignore Template" icon="file-excel">

  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Underestimate Timeline" icon="clock">
    Be realistic about what's achievable in 12 weeks. Include buffer time!
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Insufficient Literature Review" icon="book">
    **Problem:** Only 2-3 references, all from websites

    **Solution:**
    - Use Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, university library databases
    - Aim for 10-15 quality references
    - 80% should be peer-reviewed journal or conference papers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Unrealistic Timeline" icon="calendar">
    **Problem:** Planning to complete WP4 (ROS2) in 1 week

    **Solution:**
    - ROS2 setup alone takes 1-2 weeks
    - SLAM and navigation need 4-6 weeks
    - Build in 20% buffer time for delays
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Missing Components in BOM" icon="list">
    **Problem:** Forgetting wires, connectors, fasteners, power supply

    **Solution:**
    - Include EVERYTHING: screws, jumper wires, heat shrink, etc.
    - Add 10-15% contingency budget
    - List spare components
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. No Risk Mitigation" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Problem:** Identifying risks but no mitigation strategies

    **Solution:**
    - For each risk, provide specific, actionable mitigation
    - Show you've thought through contingencies
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Weak Team Contract" icon="file-contract">
    **Problem:** Vague rules like "we'll meet regularly"

    **Solution:**
    - Be specific: "Every Friday 1:30-3:00 PM in Room 205"
    - Include clear consequences
    - All members must sign
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
