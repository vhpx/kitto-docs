## Overview

This page guides you through assembling your Mecanum robot, from 3D printing parts to final integration of all subsystems.

## Pre-Assembly Checklist

Before you start assembly, ensure you have:

- [ ] All 3D printed parts (cleaned and tested)
- [ ] All purchased components (motors, wheels, electronics)
- [ ] Complete fastener set (M3 screws, nuts, standoffs)
- [ ] Tools (hex keys, screwdrivers, pliers, wire strippers)
- [ ] Wiring diagram handy
- [ ] Multimeter for electrical testing

## 3D Printing Tips

<Warning>
  **Remember:** Maximum **2 prints per group**! Print smart.
</Warning>

### Pre-Print Verification

1. **Check Models:**
   - All STL files error-free
   - Holes correct size (3.2mm for M3 tapping)
   - No impossible overhangs

2. **Slicer Settings:**
   ```
   Material: PLA (easy) or PETG (stronger)
   Layer: 0.2mm
   Infill: 25% gyroid
   Walls: 3 perimeters
   Supports: Minimize (design for printability)
   Brim: 5mm for bed adhesion
   ```

3. **Print Orientation:**
   - Strongest along layer lines
   - Minimize supports
   - Flat surfaces on bed

### Post-Printing

- Remove supports carefully
- Clean holes with 3mm drill bit
- Tap M3 threads or use heat-set inserts
- Test fit before final assembly

    Front
  ┌───────┐
  │ \   / │   Rollers form "X" pattern
  │  \ /  │   viewed from top
  │  / \  │

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Testing Checklist

After assembly, systematically test:

- [ ] Power rails: 12V and 5V present
- [ ] ESP32 powers on (LED indicator)
- [ ] Raspberry Pi boots
- [ ] Each motor spins (test individually)
- [ ] Encoder signals read correctly
- [ ] IMU communicates (I2C scan)
- [ ] LiDAR spins and publishes data
- [ ] No excessive heat from components
- [ ] All wheels rotate freely by hand
- [ ] No loose wires or parts

## Weight Distribution

For best performance:

- **Battery Low:** Improves stability, lowers center of gravity
- **Heavy Components Centered:** Balance prevents tipping
- **Symmetric:** Even weight distribution left/right, front/back
- **Target Weight:** 2-4 kg total (lighter = less motor load)

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Robot drifts in one direction | Wheel misalignment, uneven motor speeds | Check wheel orientation, calibrate PID |
| Motors stutter | Low voltage, loose encoder wires | Check battery charge, secure connections |
| One motor not working | Wiring error, bad driver | Test motor directly, check driver connections |
| ESP32 won't program | USB driver, wrong COM port | Install drivers, check Device Manager |
| IMU not responding | I2C wiring, address conflict | Check SDA/SCL, scan I2C bus |
| LiDAR no data | USB power, driver issue | Check USB cable, install rplidar_ros |

## Maintenance Tips

**Weekly:**
- Check all screws (vibration loosens them)
- Inspect wires for wear
- Clean wheel rollers
- Verify battery voltage

**Monthly:**
- Re-tighten set screws
- Check motor brush wear
- Update firmware if needed

## Documentation

Take photos during assembly:
- Before/after each major step
- Close-ups of connections
- Label everything clearly
- Create assembly video (useful for presentation!)
