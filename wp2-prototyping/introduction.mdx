description: "Introduction to CAD design, PCB design, and mechanical assembly for the Mecanum robot"
---

## Overview

Work Package 2 transforms your MATLAB simulation into physical reality through mechanical and electrical design. You'll create:

- **3D CAD model** of the robot chassis and components
- **PCB/wiring diagram** for all electrical connections
- **Bill of Materials** with exact part specifications
- **Assembly documentation** for building the robot

<Note>
  **Duration:** 4 weeks (runs in parallel with WP1 and WP3)
  **Can be split:** Different team members work on CAD vs PCB simultaneously
</Note>

## Deliverables

### D2.1: CAD Design
**Suggested Time:** 4 weeks

**What to deliver:**
- Complete 3D model of robot in CAD software (Fusion 360, SolidWorks, or FreeCAD)
- Assembly with all components (chassis, motors, wheels, electronics mounting)
- Bill of Materials (BOM) including all fasteners
- Key dimensions and technical drawing
- STL files ready for 3D printing

**Success Criteria:**
- Model is mechanically sound (proper clearances, mounting holes)
- All parts fit together in assembly
- Realistic and buildable design
- Professional-quality renderings for documentation

### D2.2: PCB Design
**Suggested Time:** 4 weeks

**What to deliver:**
- Complete wiring diagram or PCB schematic (EasyEDA, Cadence, or KiCad)
- Clear connection diagram showing all components
- Power distribution design
- Cable routing plan
- Safety considerations documented

**Success Criteria:**
- All electrical connections clearly shown
- No short circuit risks
- Proper gauge wires for current levels
- Organized and maintainable layout
- Can be replicated by another team

<Warning>
  **3D Printing Limit:** Each group has maximum **2 prints**. Design carefully and learn from other groups before printing!
</Warning>

## Why Prototyping Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Design Validation" icon="check-double">
    CAD lets you verify mechanical fit before ordering parts. Check clearances, mounting holes, and assembly sequence virtually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manufacturing Planning" icon="industry">
    Understand what needs to be fabricated (3D printed, laser cut, purchased). Generate accurate BOM with quantities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Electrical Safety" icon="bolt">
    PCB/wiring design prevents shorts, fires, and component damage. Plan for proper fusing, wire gauge, and connections.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Team Communication" icon="comments">
    CAD and schematics are universal language. Mechanical and electrical team members coordinate through drawings.

## Design Requirements

### Mechanical Requirements

Your robot must accommodate:

**Motors & Wheels:**
- 4× DC motors (12V, 333RPM) with encoders
- 4× Mecanum wheels (typically 100mm diameter)
- Motor mounting brackets with proper alignment

**Electronics:**
- ESP32 microcontroller board
- 4× IBT-2 motor drivers (BTS7960)
- ICM-20948 IMU sensor
- Raspberry Pi 4/5 (onboard computer)
- LiDAR A1M8 sensor
- Camera module (optional)

**Power:**
- Battery pack (LiPo/Li-Ion, 12V, 5000mAh+)
- Power distribution (12V for motors, 5V for logic)
- Emergency stop switch (recommended)

**Dimensions:**
- Wheelbase (L): ~300mm (suggested)
- Track width (W): ~250mm (suggested)
- Overall footprint: flexible, but consider maneuverability
- Height: accommodate all electronics and sensors

### Electrical Requirements

**Power Distribution:**
- 12V main bus for motors
- 5V regulated for ESP32, Raspberry Pi, sensors
- Proper current handling for each motor driver (~3A peak per motor)

**Signal Connections:**
- ESP32 GPIO to motor drivers (PWM, EN)
- ESP32 GPIO to encoders (quadrature A/B)
- ESP32 I2C to IMU
- USB between Raspberry Pi and ESP32 (optional, can use serial)
- LiDAR to Raspberry Pi (USB)

**Safety:**
- Fuses on power lines
- Emergency stop capability
- Proper wire gauge (see AWG charts)
- Heat dissipation for motor drivers
