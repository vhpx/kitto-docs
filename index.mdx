## Welcome to Engineering Design 3

This comprehensive guide will help you successfully complete **EEET2610: Engineering Design 3** - a project-based course where you'll design, build, and program an autonomous Mecanum wheel robot.

### What You'll Build

By the end of this semester, you and your team will have created:

- **Mecanum wheel robot** with omnidirectional movement capabilities
- **Embedded control system** using ESP32 microcontroller
- **Autonomous navigation** using ROS2, LiDAR, and computer vision
- **Complete project documentation** for your engineering portfolio

### Course Structure

This project is organized into **5 Work Packages (WP)**, each building upon the previous:
