## Handling Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does the robot know where it is?" icon="crosshairs">
    **Answer:**
    "The robot uses sensor fusion combining:
    1. **Wheel odometry** from motor encoders (short-term position)
    2. **IMU** for orientation and angular velocity
    3. **AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization)** which compares LiDAR scans to the map to correct odometry drift

    The Extended Kalman Filter fuses odometry and IMU at 50 Hz, and AMCL provides the map → odom transform for global localization."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does path planning work?" icon="route">
    **Answer:**
    "We use Nav2's two-level planning approach:
    1. **Global Planner (NavFn):** Computes optimal path from start to goal using the static map. Uses Dijkstra's algorithm for complete path.
    2. **Local Planner (DWB):** Follows the global path while avoiding dynamic obstacles. Samples velocity space, simulates trajectories, and selects the best one using cost functions.

    The local planner runs at 20 Hz for real-time obstacle avoidance, while global replanning occurs at 1 Hz or when the path is blocked."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you avoid obstacles?" icon="shield">
    **Answer:**
    "Obstacle avoidance uses layered costmaps:
    1. **Static layer:** From the pre-built map (walls, furniture)
    2. **Obstacle layer:** Real-time obstacles from LiDAR scan
    3. **Inflation layer:** Adds safety buffer around obstacles

    The costmap marks obstacles as 'lethal' (can't drive there) and inflates them based on robot size plus safety margin. The local planner avoids trajectories that cross inflated areas."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the robot gets stuck?" icon="life-ring">
    **Answer:**
    "Nav2 uses Behavior Trees for recovery:
    1. If navigation fails, the robot first clears the costmaps (removes old obstacle data)
    2. Then it spins 90° in place to scan the environment
    3. If still stuck, it backs up 30cm
    4. Finally, it retries navigation

    This recovery sequence runs up to 6 times before declaring failure. During testing, recovery succeeded in [X]% of stuck situations."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What challenges did you face?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Answer (be honest but positive):**
    "The main challenges were:
    1. **Odometry calibration:** Required iterative testing to get wheel radius accurate within 5%
    2. **Localization tuning:** AMCL parameters needed adjustment for our environment (particle count, noise models)
    3. **Controller tuning:** Balancing speed vs. smoothness in the DWB controller

    We solved these through systematic testing, parameter tuning, and consulting Nav2 documentation."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long did integration take?" icon="clock">
    **Answer:**
    "Full system integration took approximately [X] weeks:
    - Week 1-2: Hardware integration, ESP32 ↔ ROS2 communication
    - Week 3: Odometry calibration and sensor fusion
    - Week 4: SLAM mapping and navigation tuning
    - Week 5: Testing, optimization, and bug fixes

    The key lesson: start integration early and test incrementally!"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Contingency Plans

### Backup Strategies

**If robot fails during demo:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Quick Recovery (< 1 minute)">
    **Common fixes:**
    1. **Localization lost:**
       - Re-initialize pose in RViz (2D Pose Estimate)
       - Restart navigation goal

    2. **Robot stuck:**
       - Manually trigger recovery: `ros2 action send_goal /navigate_to_pose ...`
       - Or teleop out of stuck position, then retry

    3. **System unresponsive:**
       - Emergency stop → restart
       - If persists → switch to backup plan
  </Step>

  <Step title="Backup Plan A: Pre-Recorded Video">
    **Preparation:**
    - Record successful demo run beforehand
    - Include narration explaining what's happening
    - Have video ready on laptop

    **Usage:**
    > "Our robot is experiencing a technical issue. I have a pre-recorded video of a successful run that I'd like to show while I explain the system."

    **Note:** This demonstrates preparation but may reduce marks. Use only if robot truly cannot be fixed quickly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Backup Plan B: Teleoperation Demonstration">
    **Show manual control:**
    > "While autonomous navigation is experiencing issues, I can demonstrate the robot's omnidirectional capability and sensor integration through teleoperation."

    **Demonstrate:**
    - Omnidirectional motion (forward, strafe, diagonal)
    - LiDAR visualization (show scan in RViz)
    - Odometry tracking (show path trail)

    **Then explain:**
    - Navigation architecture
    - Why it's failing (if known)
    - How you would fix it

    **Note:** Partial credit. Better than total failure.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Backup Plan C: Explain with Diagrams">
    **If robot completely non-functional:**
    - Show system architecture diagram
    - Walk through navigation pipeline
    - Explain algorithms and implementation
    - Show code (hardware interface, launch files)
    - Answer questions in depth

    **Note:** Minimal credit for demonstration, but can still score on knowledge.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Demo-Day Failures
